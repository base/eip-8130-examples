# Example external factory (`SETDELEGATE` + EIP-8130)

Reference, **unaudited** example of an external account factory that combines
[EIP-7819](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7819) (`SETDELEGATE`) with
[EIP-8130](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8130) (Account Configuration).

EIP-8130 supports three first-class account-creation paths today: EOAs (auto-delegated to
`DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS`), already-deployed contract accounts (`importAccount`), and new accounts via the
`Create Entry` in `account_changes` (places runtime bytecode at a CREATE2 address).

Path 3 places the wallet's full runtime bytecode at every account address. For wallets that share a common
implementation across many accounts, this is wasteful (up to ~4.9M gas to deposit a 24 KB implementation,
repeated per account) and forecloses on-chain upgradeability.

`SETDELEGATE` (opcode `0xf6`, EIP-7819) lets a contract place a 23-byte delegation indicator
(`0xef0100 || target`) at a deterministic address. Combining it with EIP-8130's `importAccount` gives a
fourth, off-spec path with state and gas savings plus factory-mediated upgradeability — **without any changes
to AccountConfiguration** and without AccountConfiguration ever knowing the factory exists.

## How the bootstrap window is tracked

The account has no key, so at import time there is no signature anyone can produce — authorization is purely
structural (the address commits to the actor set). The only question the account's ERC-1271 must answer during
its own import is *"am I in the one-time bootstrap window?"*.

The account answers that from **its own transient state**, not from AccountConfiguration's sequence counter:

- `BootstrapAccount.bootstrap` sets a transient (EIP-1153) latch, calls `importAccount` **on itself**, then
  clears the latch — all in one call frame.
- While the latch is set (only across that nested `importAccount`), `isValidSignature` validates the presented
  digest against the primed actors hash and chainId. Otherwise it defers to
  `AccountConfiguration.verifySignature`.

Because the latch lives in the account, AccountConfiguration's `importAccount` is used exactly as it ships —
no reordering of its `localSequence` write, no awareness of the factory.

## Flow

```
Phase A (off-chain) wallet computes counterfactual address
  actorsHash = keccak256(actorHash_0 || ... || actorHash_n)   // typed actor hashes
  salt       = keccak256(userSalt || actorsHash)
  account    = keccak256(0xef0100 || factory || salt)[12:]    // EIP-7819 derivation

Phase B (one tx) invokes factory.deploy(initialActors, implementation, userSalt)
  B.1 SETDELEGATE(salt, implementation)
        → code(account) = 0xef0100 || implementation (23 bytes)
        → nonce(account) = 1 (EIP-7819 step 9)
  B.2 account.bootstrap(actorsHash, chainId, initialActors)   (runs in account's storage)
        → transient latch := (actorsHash, chainId)
        → ACCOUNT_CONFIG.importAccount(account, chainId, initialActors, "")
        → AccountConfig computes ActorInitialization digest, bumps local sequence to 1
        → STATICCALL account.isValidSignature(digest, "")
              → latch set → digest matches expected → MAGIC
        → AccountConfig writes actor_config
        → transient latch := 0 (bootstrap window closed)

Phase C (optional) close the implicit-EOA path
  Send a Config Change Entry (or applySignedActorChanges) with
    actor_change = revokeActor(bytes32(bytes20(account)))
  (importAccount already disables the implicit default-EOA path on the account itself; this revokes the
   self-actorId at the actor level if it was re-enabled via an explicit self actor.)

Phase D (later) upgrade implementation
  account submits 8130 tx (authed by an actor) with calls = [[ factory.upgrade(...) ]]
        → msg.sender = account in factory.upgrade, factory runs SETDELEGATE(salt, newImpl)
        → code(account) = 0xef0100 || newImpl
```

## Squatting / front-running defenses

- `SETDELEGATE` address derivation includes `msg.sender`, so a different factory yields a different address.
- The salt commits to the actor set (`actorsHash`), so a different actor set yields a different salt and
  therefore a different address. Trying to put unintended actors at the same address is a hash collision.
- `SETDELEGATE → bootstrap` runs in one transaction frame; no intermediate window exists for a different
  transaction to interpose state changes.
- The bootstrap branch is reachable only while the transient latch is set, which is only across the nested
  `importAccount` inside `bootstrap`. The latch is cleared before `bootstrap` returns and, being transient,
  cannot persist past the transaction. After import, `importAccount`'s one-time guard
  (`localSequence == 0`) also prevents any second import. The branch is therefore reachable exactly once.
- A codeless counterfactual address cannot be imported: a no-code STATICCALL returns empty data, the magic
  check fails, `importAccount` reverts. Squatting on counterfactual EOAs is impossible.

## Contracts

| Contract | Role |
|----------|------|
| `SetDelegateFactory` | Deploys via `SETDELEGATE`, then calls the account's `bootstrap`. Owns the address-derivation logic and the optional `upgrade` path. Holds no reference to AccountConfiguration. |
| `IBootstrap` | Minimal interface the implementation must expose for atomic priming + self-import. |
| `BootstrapAccount` | Minimal bootstrap-aware reference implementation. ERC-1271 has a BOOTSTRAP branch (gated by a transient latch) that validates the import digest against the primed `actorsHash` + `chainId`, and otherwise defers to `AccountConfiguration.verifySignature`. |

## Spec-side prerequisite

This pattern relies on one `AccountConfiguration.importAccount` property, already in place upstream:

- **No delegation-indicator reject.** `importAccount` does not reject accounts whose code begins with the
  delegation indicator (`0xef0100`). An earlier draft rejected them, but that rule never closed an attack
  surface — a compromised k1 key already drains a delegated EOA via standard 7702 / 1559 transactions — while
  it did block the entire SETDELEGATE factory pattern. The ERC-1271 callback is the sole binding between the
  account and its initial actor set, which naturally rejects code-less addresses and dishonest implementations.

No other change to AccountConfiguration is required: the account tracks its own bootstrap window in transient
storage, so `importAccount` is used exactly as shipped.

## Caveats

- **EIP-7819 is Draft** and `SETDELEGATE` (opcode `0xf6`) is not yet executable on most chains. In tests,
  `SetDelegateFactory._setDelegate` is overridden by `TestableSetDelegateFactory` to simulate the opcode
  via `vm.etch`. Production uses the real opcode.
- **EIP-1153 transient storage** is used for the bootstrap latch; it is scoped to the bootstrap transaction
  and so cannot leak into normal operation.
- The reference `BootstrapAccount` is intentionally minimal: no execution, caller-authorization, or
  receive-hook plumbing beyond Solady's `Receiver`. Combine with `DefaultAccount` (or equivalent) for a
  full account.
- `importAccount` disables the implicit default-EOA path on the imported account itself (parity with
  `createAccount`). The factory revokes nothing further automatically; if an explicit self k1 actor was
  included to keep the key live, close it later with an `applySignedActorChanges` that `revokeActor`s
  `bytes32(bytes20(account))` — or stack a Config Change Entry in the same 8130 tx.
- The `actorsHash` here is the **typed** hash (matching EIP-8130's `ActorInitialization` digest). If you
  also want addresses to match the Create Entry path, switch to the **packed** commitment
  `keccak256(actorId_0 || authenticator_0 || ...)` and reconstruct the typed digest in the implementation.

## Future protocol integration (optional)

These are forward-looking notes; nothing in this directory depends on them.

1. **Canonical factory set (off-chain, by analogy to canonical authenticators).** A companion spec could
   standardize the factory + implementation pair and a deterministic CREATE2 deployment address. Wallets and
   indexers honor the set off-chain; AccountConfiguration remains unaware.
2. **`account_changes` entry type `0x03 SetDelegateCreate`.** For atomic single-tx deploys via canonical
   factories within an 8130 transaction.
3. **Do nothing protocol-side.** Factories live entirely in user space; the pattern works against
   AccountConfiguration as it ships upstream.
